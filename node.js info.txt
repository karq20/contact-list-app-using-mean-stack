WHAT IS NODE.JS

Node.js is a runtime environment and library for running JS applications outside the browser.
Node.js is mostly used to run real-time server applications and shines through its performance using non-blocking I/o and asynchronous events.

o> Javascript on the server
o> Uses V8 engine, like the Chrome browser
o> Program just like the client

JS
-> Event-driven - node can track a variety of events happening on the server
-> Non-blocking
-> Two-connections
-> Real time applications - can handle multiple apps simultaneously

Challenges

-Doesn't run on traditional servers
-Can use Heroku for node.js app deployment
-Lots of dev installs
-very concise API - need to add lot of external libraries
